            Final day is here. Assignment due tonight at 10pm. Managed to finish most of the coding yesterday, just a bunch of documentation to do and SRI and accesibility audit and forms. The point is too much to do that i don't have time to write here atm.

            BUG - I finally fixed that bug that has been bothering me for so
            long. I just couldn't get my navigation to stay fixed. Well the
            solution was simple and I'm just an idiot. Fixed is a position
            attribute not display. Felt dumb and kinda relieved at the same time
            when I realised it. CODE - Today has been super productive and I'm
            starting to feel good about my project. It still isn't a master
            piece in terms of design but It's becoming really responsive.
            Harrison (my teacher from Coder Academy) told me about a way you
            could get a on click equivalent using CSS which was awesome. This in
            turn let me do the pop up contact window I've been wanting. Also it
            kept the CSS no JS dream alive. Don't forsee any really reason I
            would need JS now. I finally uploaded the project to the web. I
            guess you could say it has gone from alpha to beta. It's not
            finished and still feel like there is a ton left to do but I'm
            getting there.

            Luckily I managed to some planning done on friday but finished it up
            today. Feeling like Im not the greatest designer, I made the
            decision not to ponder on it too much. Just pick a colour scheme and
            some fonts and run with it. The quicker I get to coding the more fun
            it be and the more time I have to see how good my CSS skills are. I
            picked a blue colour scheme with a red accent colour in case I need
            it. It was now time to start coding. As usual when I start an
            website I begin by making a index.html and style.css. Didn't get the
            most done today but at least I've started. We will see how the coming days go.

            Today we were issued the assignment to make out own Portfolio
            website. I feel like this is going to be a good one but am a little
            apprehensive as I don't necessarily think my design skills are great
            we will see what I can make. I've also found it quite hard to focus
            at home unfortunately. Either way I've decided that over the weekend
            I will get the Workbook Assignment (due on 5th of April) done and
            out of the way so I can focus on this project fully next week.

          <p>
            As I made this blog after the terminal app, I don't plan to put many
            entries here about it. In fact this is the only one. I guess I could
            summarise my experience of making the app as a positive one. I enjoy
            Ruby its feels lighter than Java and it quite fun and challenging
            making the app. As with all my projects time is my biggest enemy and
            I didn't get to do all the cool stuff I wanted to do but who knows
            maybe in the future I will work on it more. For now thought probably
            focus on newer things.
