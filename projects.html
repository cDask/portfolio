                The website you are currently on. This project was developed as
                an assignment from coder academy course and involved making a
                online portfolio to showcase our front-end skills. Building this
                site took about 4 days and only uses html and css. Restricting
                this website to just CSS without JavaScript was an interesting
                challenge and required some ingenuity. Unfortunately CSS cant
                replace JavaScript completely so there were certain
                restrictions. Without JS each HTML had to written out making a
                lot of redundant code. Thankfully the use SASS helped make the
                CSS a little easier to organise. To learn a little more about
                problems and my coding experience with this project check out my
                code blog.

                This was a terminal based app that was issued as an assignment
                by coder academy. The aim the assignment was to make a small
                application that ran in terminal. For my terminal app I decided
                to make a travel companion. The app would has a pseudo login
                where each person logged on can record the countries and date
                they travelled there. It could then take this and display
                statistics about how many countries they've travelled in the
                world and different continents. It also allows you to search a
                country and then get some facts such as capital, currency and
                name of the country in different languages. All data is
                persistent and the project was written entirely in Ruby with
                some JSON files to hold the data. You can check out the project
                by pressing the github below.
